## Workbook Content

The Workbook is divided into 3 parts:

### **Technical Skills**

This section is divided into Frontend and Backend. Feel free to go into each and get all benefits, but be mindful of the time you're taking to study the topics.

The topics are as follows:

- Lifecycle of page/Component rendering
- Local and global state
- State management tools

#### **Backend**

- Application Programming Interface (API)
- Representational State Transfer (REST)

### **Soft Skills**

This section deals with various topics that are related to improving your communication skills.

The topics are as follows:

- Ownership
- Time Management & Procrastination

### **Weekly Assignment**

In the Weekly Assignment you have 2 main tasks:

1. _Self Assessment_

   In this assignment you will reflect on what you've learned about that week, both the technical and soft skills concepts! Answer each question by (1) giving your opinion, and if applicable (2) an example.

2. _Algorithm Challenge_

   In order to practice your ability to think algorithmically, you'll solve a weekly challenge. You are tasked to (1) solve the challenge in code and (2) write down your approach in pseudocode

When you've finished both take the following steps to submit your work:

1. Create the right filetype for each assignment (i.e. _razan-selfassessment-w2.txt_ & _razan-algochallenge-w2.js_)
2. Make a pull request to the `main` branch of the `tap-cohort-4` repository
3. Assign your mentor to the pull request
4. Do a little victory dance because you did it!
