● Why is “thinking in components” useful when building a webpage?

Thinking in components has many advantages, one of them is the reusibilty of the compopnent in 
other places which saves time and refactors the code, another thing is that the programm
becomes more understandable for others. Another advantage is that we can work on each
component on its own even though other components are not ready yet. It also helps in 
debugging when something does not work good

really want it to be done which will help you also to manage our time better, as you will 
create yourself some time for the task to be done
